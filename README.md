## About

The KMP algorithm is a string matching algorithm that uses pre-processing to improve the performance of pattern matching. By using native coroutines in Kotlin, we are able to leverage the power of parallel processing to achieve even better performance. If you are looking for a fast and efficient solution for pattern matching, then this KMP native coroutines algorithm is the right choice for you.
